# web (Next.js)

This is a minimal Next.js app for the ScienceWithMsGobolos site.

Quick start:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Pages created:
- / (Home)
- /scholarship
- /chemistry-12
- /chemistry-11
- /anatomy-physiology
- /calculus-12

Notes:
- This scaffold uses the Pages Router (Next.js 13 compatible). If you'd prefer the App Router, I can convert it.
- If you want me to install dependencies and run the dev server here, say so and I'll run the commands in your terminal.
